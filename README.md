# Yeet-Turtle
These are some creative ways to yeet computers. Be careful when doing things you don't understand, read the documentation in this file before running anything. There has been risk assesment done on the files and they have been organised into sub-directories accordingly. If you just want to mess around, try *Non-Malicious\No Risk*. 
# Target System
These files are intended to be run on Windows 7, but have been developed on Windows 10. All versions of Windows NT since Windows 7 should be supported, and Windows Vista and XP may also work with some files. The files are intened for an x86 system architechture, but were developed on an x64 system architechture. You should not need admin privliges to run these files, but some may need to be run as an administrator (see below). 
# Running as Administrator
To run a file as an administrator, right click the file and click *Run as Administrator*. Only do this if told to by the instructions. You do not need admin privileges to perform this action.
# How to use
To use this repository, download a release from the releases tab on the GitHub repo. Most of the files can be run off a memory stick, but you may want to copy the files onto the target device. Before running anything, read the instructions for the program below. In order to run .bat, .cmd, and .exe files, double click them. Some programs may ask you to run as administrator, but do not do so unless told to by the documentation.
# Sub-directories
## Non-Malicious
These files are generally safe and will not do serious damage to your machine, but still be careful when using them. The files have been organised by riskiness. This means how likely they are to damage your machine and how likely you are to be caught.
### No Risk
These files are not risky. They can be run safely, and should not trigger any warnings for administrators. This does mean, however, that they aren't very powerful.
#### Calculator.bat
A command line calculator. Enter expressions using +, -, *, or /. For example, `2+3`. Only use one operand per expression. Follow instructions within the program as required. No need to run as administrator.
#### Counter.bat
Repeatedly increments a number by 1 and writes it to the output. When the number reaches 1000, it decrements instead. At 0, it increments again. No user input. No need to run as administrator.
#### full.bat
Attempts to opens a commandline window in fullscreen, fails because it's a piece of shit. No user input. No need to run as administrator.
### Some Risk
These files may be risky. They can be run safetly most of the time, but be cautious as they may trigger warnings for administrators. They are more useful than the files in the *No Risk* category.
#### Embed Shockwave In HTML\Embed Shockwave In HTML.bat
This file is used to take a shockwave flash file and embed it within a HTMl file that can be opened in a browser and run. Follow the instructions within the program. You need a shockwave file to embed, download this from somewhere or make your own if you know how to. An example file has been provided if you just want to have a go. A functional use of this would be to download flash games and play them offline. This file writes to files in the working directory. Make sure there is nothing important as it may be deleted. **Do not run as administrator.**
#### getDirTree.bat
**Incomplete, do not run**
#### IP_Encyclopedia.bat
Tool for sending ping requests to other devices connected to the internet. Can use IP address or web address. Follow instructions in program. No need to run as administrator.
### Very Risky
These files are very risky. They can get you in trouble if you get caught, and have the potential to do damage to the system if missused. They are the most useful non-malicious files.
#### Instant_Shutdown
This file will shutdown the target system immediately, without any warning. Since this is an irregular way to shutdown,
it could draw attention to your activity. This will not affect any machine other than the machine it runs on. No need to run as administrator.
#### Python.zip
A portable version of python 3.8.1 that can be run off a memory stick. Needed to run files with a .py extension. To run the interpreter, extract the python folder, run *Python\WinPython Interpreter.exe*. Do not run any other file within this folder unless you know what it does. This is dangerous territory where anti-virus is considered. No need to run as administrator.

## Malicious
# THESE FILES ARE DANGEROUS AND COULD DO DAMAGE TO THE TARGET SYSTEM. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!
Make sure you understand how each program works before running it. Even if you do not damage anything, you could still be caught!
**There are currently no malicious files avaliable. Some are in development.**
